</p>

---

### Media — Music manager

Download, organize, and sync MP3s to your watch. Multiple integrated workflows cover every way you add music.

#### Library

Your local MP3 collection, ready to transfer.

- **Full library table** with title, size, date, and watch sync status
- **Transfer single tracks** or **transfer all** pending downloads at once
- **Multi-select bulk delete** to clean up your local library
- **Watch storage meter** showing how much of the watch's capacity is in use
- **Live sync state** between the two panels — connected, syncing, pending, or
  all synced

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/library.png" alt="Media library" width="900" />
</p>

#### YouTube

Browse YouTube inside the app and download MP3s without leaving the page.

- **Embedded YouTube browser** with back, forward, home, and search
- **Green MP3 buttons** injected on video thumbnails for one-tap downloads
- **Playlist download** support on watch and playlist pages
- **Background download queue** with live progress — keep browsing while tracks download

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/youtube.png" alt="YouTube browser" width="900" />
</p>

#### Spotify

Sync your Spotify playlists to MP3s and your watch.

- **OAuth login** with your own Spotify Developer app credentials
- **Browse owned and collaborative playlists** with sync status
- **Auto-match tracks** via YouTube search (`<artist> <track> official audio`)
- **Optional auto-transfer** to your watch when connected over USB

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/spotify.png" alt="Spotify sync" width="900" />
</p>

#### YouTube Playlists

Sync your YouTube channel playlists with Google OAuth.

- **Google OAuth login** with your own Google Cloud OAuth credentials
- **Browse your playlists** and queue individual tracks for download
- **Background download queue** with live progress

#### YouTube Music

Sync your YouTube Music library playlists and liked songs.

- **In-app sign-in** — connect from CorosLink with automatic header capture (manual DevTools paste still available as a fallback)
- **Sync playlists and liked songs** from your library
- **Queue tracks** to download and transfer to your watch
- Requires **Python 3.10+** and **`ytmusicapi`** (`python3 -m pip install ytmusicapi`)

#### Apple Music

Browse your Apple Music library playlists and queue tracks for download.

- **In-app sign-in** — connect from CorosLink with automatic `amp-api` header capture (manual DevTools paste still available as a fallback)
- **Library playlists** load when library access is available from the captured session
- **Tracks resolve via YouTube search** — Apple Music streams are DRM-protected, so downloads use the same YouTube matching flow as Spotify sync

#### Apple Podcasts

Find a show from the public Apple Podcasts catalogue or paste its Apple Podcasts link, then download individual public RSS episodes directly as MP3s.

- **No sign-in required** — public show metadata and RSS feeds load directly
- **Progressive episode browsing** — load the latest 50 downloadable RSS enclosures first, then append older episodes as needed
- **Direct audio downloads** — episode audio goes through the existing queue and converts to MP3 for your watch
- **Subscriber-only and feedless episodes are excluded** — CorosLink only downloads publicly available RSS audio

---

### Maps — Watch maps and routes (BETA)

Download official COROS map regions and build custom GPX routes from your desktop.

#### Official map packages

Browse, cache, and install COROS map data to your watch over USB.

- **Browse official map regions** (Landscape and Topo) from the COROS v5 manifest
- **Search and filter** regions; download and cache packages locally
- **Watch storage panel** — maps vs other usage and free space at a glance
- **Install to watch** over USB with live copy progress
- **Choose a local map folder** for cached packages on your computer

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/map.png" alt="COROS map packages and watch install" width="900" />
</p>

#### Route builder

Generate GPX routes and send them to your phone for import into the COROS app.

- **Generate loop or point-to-point routes** with an OpenRouteService API key
- **Import GPX files** from Strava, Komoot, or anywhere else — loaded as saved routes with distance, elevation, and loop detection
- **Sport presets** — running, walking, hiking, road cycling, and mountain biking — plus elevation preference
- **Interactive map preview** with start pin, fit route, and layer themes
- **Route stats** — distance, estimated time and pace, ascent/descent, and elevation profile
- **Export GPX** and **Share to phone** (QR) for import into the COROS mobile app's route library

Direct cloud upload to your COROS account is not wired yet; GPX export via the phone app is the supported path today.

### Watch Faces — official iPhone hand-off (EXPERIMENTAL)

Publish an existing, valid COROS custom-watchface template archive from desktop,
then claim it through COROS's official share page on iPhone.

- **Template creator** — compose a background with colors and optional artwork;
  CorosLink builds a fresh archive while retaining the template's
  live time, date, battery, and complication controls
- **Digit & theme studio** — re-render the template's bitmap-font digit sprites
  in a locally installed font and color, and recolor weekday labels, battery
  digits, and metric icons; every resolution and the always-on-display tree is
  regenerated (AOD sprites are auto-dimmed) at the template's exact pixel sizes
- **Live sprite preview** — the on-screen face is composited from the same
  sprite bitmaps and `config.txt` layout the watch itself will render
- **Independent time styling** — resize and recolor hour and minute bitmap
  sprites separately while keeping each two-digit group centered
- **Draggable static separators (experimental)** — replace the template-anchored
  time colon and date slash with background-rendered separators that support
  exact X/Y, size, color, and direct preview dragging
- **Custom design sprites** — import up to twelve static PNG/JPEG/WebP layers,
  then drag, scale, rotate, position, and remove them before they are composited
  into the generated watchface background
- **Persistent watchface projects** — save the starter `.dat` together with
  artwork, custom sprites, component styles, separators, and layout offsets;
  reopen the project after restarting CorosLink and continue editing
- **Per-metric bitmap styling (experimental)** — give fixed heart-rate, steps,
  calorie, and elevation values their own color and 50–200% sprite scale;
  CorosLink generates an isolated ten-digit folder for each customized metric
- **Drag-to-move layout (experimental)** — position hours, minutes, weekday,
  month, day, battery, and metric elements independently; CorosLink rewrites the matching
  `config.txt` position keys for every resolution (scaled automatically)
- **Independent always-on studio** — switch to `AODconfig.txt` and edit its
  existing firmware layers, artwork, styles, effects, visibility, and placement
  without changing the current display; shared template sprites are isolated
  into AOD-owned folders during export
- **Live metric studio (experimental)** — activate fixed heart rate, steps,
  calories, and elevation fields when the source template exposes them; preview
  the selectable metric slot and drag every enabled field into place
- **Official source-template browser** — query COROS's editable-template
  catalog for the selected watch model, download the source ZIP, validate its
  manifest, and select it as the creator's starter in one step
- **3-pane watchface editor (beta)** — layer-based editor alongside the creator,
  with background canvas, local fonts, weather/temperature, and sprite tinting
- **Battery history & device info** — Bluetooth battery history and device
  details for a connected watch
- **Region-aware mobile login** — choose US / EU / CN so watchface publish works
  for accounts registered in those regions
- **Archive validation** — checks the ZIP/.dat package has `info.json`, a source
  template ID, DIY version, and a custom-face preview before upload
- **Separate mobile session** — signs in to the mobile COROS API; only the
  resulting session is kept in encrypted OS storage, never the password
- **Precision-safe publish flow** — preserves COROS's large template IDs exactly
  while creating the custom template and its time-limited share URL
- **QR hand-off** — scan the generated official COROS URL on the paired iPhone,
  save the face in COROS, then send it to the watch from the COROS app
- **Advanced tools** — legacy 614A carrier editor and raw `.bin` watchface
  installer for supported workflows

This is not a full bypass of the iPhone COROS app for normal publish hand-off.
Advanced raw install paths are experimental; endpoints are undocumented and may
change. Only upload or install archives you are entitled to use.

### Training Hub — COROS analytics dashboard

Log in with your COROS account to view training data, fitness scores, and race predictions — right on your desktop.

- **COROS account login** with email and password
- **Summary tiles** for Stamina, Recovery, Training Load, and Resting HR
- **Recovery readiness ring** with stamina overlay
- **7-day charts** for Training Load and HRV vs Baseline
- **EvoLab fitness scores** — Aerobic Endurance, Lactate Threshold, Anaerobic Endurance and Capacity
- **Race predictor** with estimated finish times by distance
- **Recent activities table** with a detail panel for laps, HR, elevation, and more
- **Strength activity detail** — set/rep summary and exercise table with resolved exercise names
- **Sleep & daily health** — sleep score/stages plus steps and calories from COROS data
- **FIT file export** via signed download URL
- **Bulk activity backup** — download your entire activity history (FIT, GPX, TCX, KML, or CSV) to a local folder; re-running only fetches new activities
- **Push activities to COROS** — import from intervals.icu or add manual activities

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/training-hub-2.png" alt="Training Hub" width="900" />
</p>

---

### Strength — resistance training analytics

A dedicated view for lifting, built around a rotatable 3D muscle mannequin that
shades each muscle by how hard you have worked it.

- **Muscle map** — per-muscle set, volume, and time breakdowns on muscular and skeletal layers
- **Weekly trends** — weight lifted and sets side by side, with push/pull/legs/core balance
- **Exercise Explorer** — open any lift for every set, per-session PRs, best sets by rep range, estimated one-rep-max progression, and volume over time
- **Hevy sync** — connect a Hevy API key to merge Hevy workouts with your COROS strength history; sessions logged in both apps are de-duplicated, warmup sets are optional, and disconnecting erases the cached Hevy data
- **Metric or imperial** weights and volume, following the Settings unit switch

---

### Training Library — workouts, plans, templates, and adherence

A dedicated workspace for building and reusing training, from one structured
workout through a complete multi-week cycle.

- **Workout Library** — search, filter, sort, preview full steps, create with the
  sport-aware builder, edit with revision checks, duplicate, tag, collect,
  export, schedule, and safely delete COROS workouts; tiles draw each workout's
  step structure, its training load relative to the rest of the library, and
  when it was last scheduled, in the sport's own colour
- **Training Plans** — discover and cache native COROS plans, build local grouped
  plans, drag workouts across days and a holding area, add rest days and phases,
  duplicate/reorder/recovery weeks, shift start dates, and undo/redo changes
- **Templates** — reusable local plans and collections, including templates
  created from completed activities
- **Plan comparison** — compare two or three plans by duration, distance,
  training load, strength sets, sport/intensity mix, weekly progression, peak
  week, taper, shared workouts, and scheduling conflicts
- **Completed & adherence** — automatic confidence-scored calendar/activity
  matching, manual correction, skipped/missed/partial states, rescheduling, and
  planned-versus-completed metrics
- **Offline-aware sync** — cached data remains visible when one or more COROS
  reads fail, with explicit local/synced/pending/conflicted/failed/stale states

Native COROS plan discovery and detail reads are active. Native grouped-plan
writes remain visibly gated until the undocumented create/update/activation
contract can be verified without guessing; local templates and the existing
individual Workout Library/Calendar writes remain available.

---

### Calendar — scheduled workouts and activities

Month and week views for planned workouts and completed activities on one grid.

- **Drag-and-drop reschedule** for future workouts
- **Add / delete workouts** and week stats
- **Ask Coach** handoff from a selected day or week

---

### Coach — training chatbot

Ask training questions with answers grounded in your COROS data.

- **Providers** — ChatGPT (cloud), Claude via your subscription (Claude Code) or your own Anthropic API key, OpenRouter with your own API key, or local LLMs (Ollama / LM Studio)
- **Model selection & extended thinking** where the provider supports them
- **Multi-sport workout tools** — draft a single workout or adaptive multi-week plans across Run, Trail Run, Bike, Pool Swim, Strength, Indoor Climb, Bouldering, XC Ski, and HYROX, with COROS exercise catalog search for Strength and HYROX
- **Destination-aware confirmation** — choose Workout Library, Calendar, local template, COROS Plan Library, or Plan + Calendar; review weeks, workouts, sports, start date, conflicts, grouped-plan status, and every remote write before confirming
- **AI write guard** — Coach tool calls can draft workouts and plans but cannot upload them; the athlete must use the confirmation card
- **Follow-up questions** — Coach asks one clarifying question at a time with tappable answers instead of guessing; typing an answer still works
- **Chat history** — per-provider conversations persist across restarts

---

## How it works

CorosLink uses independent data paths — USB for watch files, OpenRouteService for routes, and COROS APIs for training.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  YouTube --> ytDlp[yt-dlp + ffmpeg]
  Spotify --> ytDlp
  YouTubeMusic[YouTube Music] --> ytDlp
  AppleMusic[Apple Music] --> ytDlp
  ApplePodcasts[Apple Podcasts RSS] --> ytDlp
  YouTubePlaylists[YouTube Playlists] --> ytDlp

  USBMaps --> Watch
  GPX --> PhoneApp[COROS phone app]
  COROSAccount[COROS account] --> TeamAPI[teamapi.coros.com]
  TeamAPI --> Dashboard[Training Hub]
```

**Music sync** does not use an official COROS SDK. The app detects your watch when it mounts as a USB drive with a `Music` folder, then copies MP3 files directly.

**Map install** downloads official packages from COROS map servers, caches them locally, and copies them to your watch's map folder over USB.

**Route builder** calls OpenRouteService to generate a route, then exports GPX for import through the COROS phone app (Bluetooth sync to the watch).

**Training Hub** authenticates with COROS team APIs to fetch your analytics, activities, and fitness scores. Credentials are sent to COROS servers at login; all other app data stays on your machine.

---

## Install

### Download

Get the latest installer from **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/releases)**:

| Platform              | File                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `CorosLink-*-arm64.dmg`       |
| macOS (Intel)         | `CorosLink-*-x64.dmg`         |
| Windows               | `CorosLink Setup *.exe`       |
| Linux (x64)           | `CorosLink-*-x86_64.AppImage` |

Open the DMG, then drag **CorosLink** into **Applications** when the installer window appears. If Finder only shows a plain folder, drag `CorosLink.app` into Applications manually.

#### macOS: “app is damaged” or won’t open

Release DMGs from GitHub are **signed and notarized**. If Gatekeeper still blocks an older or locally built unsigned copy, clear the quarantine flag after installing:

```sh
xattr -cr "/Applications/CorosLink.app"
```

Then open normally. If that still fails, right-click the app → **Open** → **Open** again.

Windows may show a SmartScreen prompt for unsigned installers — click **More info** → **Run anyway**.

On Linux, download the AppImage, mark it executable (`chmod +x CorosLink-*.AppImage`), then run it. Most desktop environments can also open AppImages directly from the file manager.

### In-app updates

Packaged builds check **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/releases)** for new versions on launch. When an update is available, CorosLink downloads it in the background and shows **Restart to update** in the header. You can also click the version badge to check manually.

> **First release with in-app updates:** Users on v0.1.7 or earlier must install manually once. After that, updates arrive in-app. Signed macOS builds (v0.1.16+) support reliable in-app update install.

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink.git
cd CorosLink
npm install
npm run rebuild
npm run dist:mac    # macOS DMG (run on macOS)
npm run dist:win    # Windows NSIS installer (run on Windows)
npm run dist:linux  # Linux AppImage (run on Linux)
```

Installers are written to `release/`.

### Requirements

- **macOS**, **Windows**, or **Linux**
- **USB cable** to connect your COROS watch for music and map sync
- **yt-dlp** and **ffmpeg** — bundled in packaged builds; falls back to `PATH` if missing
- **OpenRouteService API key** (optional) — only needed for Route Builder
- **OpenRouter API key** (optional) — only needed when OpenRouter is selected for Coach compute
- **Spotify Developer app** (optional) — only needed for Spotify playlist sync
- **Google Cloud OAuth app** (optional) — only needed for YouTube Playlists sync
- **Python 3.10+** and **ytmusicapi** (optional) — only needed for YouTube Music library sync
- **COROS account** (optional) — only needed for Training Hub

---

## Privacy and data

- **Music and downloads** — stored locally in the Electron user data directory (SQLite database + MP3 files on disk)
- **Spotify tokens** — stored locally in SQLite after OAuth; never sent anywhere except Spotify
- **Google OAuth tokens** — stored locally in SQLite after OAuth; used only for YouTube Data API playlist reads
- **YouTube Music / Apple Music headers** — stored locally and used only to read your library metadata; never sent to CorosLink servers
- **Apple Podcasts** — public catalogue searches and RSS feeds are requested directly to discover publicly downloadable episodes; no account credentials are collected
- **Map cache** — downloaded map packages are stored in a local folder you choose; copied to the watch over USB only
- **OpenRouteService** — route requests are sent to OpenRouteService when you generate a route (your API key is stored locally)
- **OpenRouter** — when selected for Coach, coaching prompts and requested COROS tool data are sent through OpenRouter to the model you choose; the API key is encrypted in local app storage
- **Training Hub** — your COROS email and password are used to authenticate with COROS servers. Activity data is fetched on demand and not synced to any third-party service
- **No cloud sync** — the app does not run its own backend or upload your files

> Only download media you have the rights or permission to download.

## Development

<details>
<summary><strong>Development setup</strong></summary>

```sh
npm install
npm run rebuild
npm run binaries:prepare
npm run dev
```

The dev command starts Vite at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` and launches Electron. `npm run rebuild` prepares native SQLite bindings for Electron. `npm run dev` automatically runs `binaries:prepare` before Electron starts, downloading the pinned `yt-dlp` release and copying the `ffmpeg-static` binary into `bin/<platform>-<arch>/`. You can also run `binaries:prepare` manually if you only need to refresh media tools.

To prepare Windows x64 media binaries from any platform:

```sh
npm run binaries:prepare:win
```

To prepare Linux x64 media binaries from any platform:

```sh
npm run binaries:prepare:linux
```

To prepare both macOS architectures (Apple Silicon and Intel) from any platform:

```sh
npm run binaries:prepare:mac
```

For hardware-free watch detection checks, set `COROS_WATCH_PATH=/path/to/mock-watch` with a `Music` folder, or run:

```sh
npm run smoke:watch
```

To regenerate README screenshots:

```sh
npm run build:electron
./node_modules/.bin/electron scripts/capture-readme-screenshots.cjs
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Spotify Developer setup</strong></summary>

Create a free Spotify app in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard), then add this redirect URI exactly:

```text
https://127.0.0.1:4567/callback
```

Paste the app's Client ID and Client Secret into the Spotify Sync view. The app opens a local OAuth login window and stores the resulting token locally in SQLite.

Playlist sync reads the authenticated user's playlists and only enables playlists that Spotify allows the user to read — currently playlists the user owns or collaborates on. Each track is searched on YouTube as `<artist> <track> official audio`, downloaded as an MP3, and saved as `Artist - Track Name.mp3`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>YouTube Playlists setup</strong></summary>

Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (Desktop app or Web application), enable the **YouTube Data API v3**, then add this redirect URI exactly:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4568
```

Paste the Client ID and Client Secret into the YouTube Playlists view, then connect. The app opens a local OAuth login window and stores tokens locally in SQLite.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>YouTube Music setup</strong></summary>

Install Python 3.10+ and ytmusicapi:

```sh
python3 -m pip install ytmusicapi
```

Open [music.youtube.com](https://music.youtube.com/library) while signed in, open DevTools (F12), go to the **Network** tab, filter for `browse`, right-click a **POST** request, and choose **Copy → Copy as cURL**. Paste the command into CorosLink and connect. Headers must include `cookie` and `x-goog-authuser`. They expire when you sign out of YouTube Music in your browser — re-paste if syncing stops.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Apple Music setup</strong></summary>

Open [music.apple.com](https://music.apple.com) while signed in, open DevTools (F12), go to the **Network** tab, filter for `amp-api`, right-click any request, and choose **Copy → Copy as cURL**. Paste into CorosLink and connect. The `authorization` bearer token is required; include `media-user-token` for personal library playlists. Tokens expire often — re-paste if fetching stops working.

Apple Music streams are DRM-protected. CorosLink reads playlist metadata from Apple and resolves each track via YouTube search for download (same approach as Spotify sync).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Packaging</strong></summary>

```sh
npm run dist
```

Before packaging, run `npm run binaries:prepare`. The packaged app checks bundled binaries first, then falls back to `PATH`.

Convenience target scripts:

```sh
npm run dist:mac
npm run dist:win
npm run dist:linux
```

For a quick local packaging layout check without code signing:

```sh
CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false npm run dist -- --dir
```

Because `better-sqlite3` is native, build Windows installers on Windows or in CI where Electron native dependencies can be rebuilt for the Windows target. The same applies to Linux AppImages on Linux.

**Publishing a release (maintainers):**

1. Prepare the version in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` so they match the tag you are about to create:

```sh
npm run release:prepare -- v0.1.18
git commit -am "chore: release v0.1.18"
git tag v0.1.18
git push origin main v0.1.18
```

2. That triggers the [Release installers](.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow. CI syncs the tag into `package.json` before building, then verifies the versions match, so installer names like `CorosLink-0.1.18-arm64.dmg` and `CorosLink-0.1.18-x64.dmg` always follow the git tag. The workflow also uploads `latest-mac.yml`, `latest-linux.yml`, and `latest.yml` plus macOS/Windows blockmaps so packaged apps can auto-update via `electron-updater` (Linux AppImage embeds its blockmap in the file). Each platform build runs `scripts/verify-release-artifacts.mjs` and fails if update metadata is missing.

You can also run the workflow manually from **Actions → Release installers** (it uses the current `package.json` version when no tag is pushed).

Pushes to `main` run [Build desktop installers](.github/workflows/build.yml) and upload CI artifacts for testing before tagging.

**Verify release artifacts locally:**

```sh
npm run dist:mac    # or dist:win / dist:linux on the matching OS
npm run release:verify-artifacts -- macos
```

After building, confirm `release/latest-mac.yml` (or `latest.yml` / `latest-linux.yml`) exists and that the packaged app contains `app-update.yml` with the GitHub publish config.

**Test auto-update end-to-end (maintainers):**

1. Tag and ship a baseline release that includes the updater (e.g. v0.1.8).
2. Install that build from GitHub Releases on a test machine.
3. Confirm the header shows a clickable version badge (not dev-only text).
4. Tag and ship a newer release (e.g. v0.1.9).
5. In the older app, wait ~5 seconds or click the version badge.
6. Expect: checking → update available → downloading → **Restart to update**.
7. Click restart; the app should relaunch on the new version.

**Windows** and **signed macOS** builds should complete this flow. Locally built unsigned macOS apps may still need a manual download from GitHub Releases.
