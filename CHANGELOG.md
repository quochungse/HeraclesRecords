# Changelog

All notable changes to CorosLink are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **CorosLink-only Claude login** — the Claude subscription provider now keeps its own credentials in the app's data folder via `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, so the app signs in to its own Claude account instead of borrowing whichever one the machine's CLI is using. Sign-in happens in-app: the browser opens Claude's page and you paste the returned code back into CorosLink. A two-way switch — Your device Claude / CorosLink-only Claude login — sits in both Settings and the sign-in screen.
- **Signed-in Claude account shown in Settings** — the connection row now names the account (email, organisation, plan) so you can tell at a glance whether the Coach is on your personal or work Claude login. Read live from the CLI on each check and never persisted.
- **Revoke the CorosLink Claude login** — sign the app out of Claude from Settings so a different account can take over. It only ever touches CorosLink's own credential store, never the machine-wide login shared with your terminal.
- **Reasoning effort for the Claude subscription provider** — pick low through max next to the model, forwarded as the Agent SDK's `effort` option. Claude drops to the highest level the selected model supports rather than failing.
- **Claude API key provider** — a fourth Coach backend that calls the Anthropic Messages API directly with your own key, billed per token, with no Claude Code install required. Pick the model (Opus 5, Fable 5, Sonnet 5, Haiku 4.5) and reasoning effort, test the key without spending tokens, and use the full COROS tool set. The key is stored encrypted on this computer.

### Fixed

- **Claude sign-in now actually completes.** The old flow spawned `claude auth login` detached with `stdio: "ignore"`, but the CLI prints an authorize URL and then waits on stdin for a pasted code — with no pipes it produced nothing and could never finish. The app now pipes the process, surfaces the URL, and forwards the code.
- Custom coach instructions now have the wrapper delimiters stripped from athlete-entered text, so a pasted `</athlete_custom_instructions>` can no longer close the block early and promote the rest of the paste to operating rules.

## [0.1.29] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- **OpenRouter Coach provider** — use an encrypted, locally stored OpenRouter API key with model selection, tool-capable model discovery, connection testing, streaming responses, and COROS-aware Coach tools.

### Fixed

- Updated the bundled `yt-dlp` release to 2026.08.19, restoring YouTube and YouTube Music audio downloads affected by YouTube's `android_vr` HTTP 403 change.

## [0.1.28] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Multi-workout Coach drafts now save as grouped, editable CorosLink training plans by default; saving their workouts individually to COROS or adding them directly to Calendar remains explicit ([#104](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/104)).

## [0.1.27] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- **Standalone Coach workout drafts** — draft, review, edit, and save a single workout (not only multi-workout plans), with COROS exercise catalog search, token-aware matching, and stricter Strength/HYROX validation; draft sources persist and restore across chat history ([#103](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/103))
- **Chat model selection** — pick provider/model for supported backends, with settings persisted across sessions ([#102](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/102))
- **Remembered view preferences** — analytics ranges/metrics, tabs, filters, sorting, layouts, map layers, calendar mode, library views, and watch-face catalog filters survive navigation and restart ([#102](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/102))

### Changed

- **Training dashboard insights** — richer trend charts, sleep summaries, chart colors/tooltips, empty states, and responsive layout; smoother activity-globe zoom ([#102](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/102))
- **Coach and calendar navigation** — clearer plan/workout review, sidebar/history flow, draft cards, response controls, and editor layouts; broader workout upload destinations and strength/recovery editing ([#102](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/102), [#103](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/103))
- Select menus, map recents, and related chrome polish ([#102](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/102))

### Fixed

- Generated-plan calendar installs now respect the selected metric/imperial unit system; existing linked workouts keep their saved units ([#102](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/102))

## [0.1.26] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- **Media library storage and sync feedback** — the watch panel shows a capacity meter with how much of the watch's storage is in use, the connector between the two panels reports its own state (disconnected, syncing, pending, all synced) and animates while a transfer batch runs, and local tracks carry a compact synced/pending dot instead of a status badge
- **Workout tiles show their shape** — every workout in the Training Library draws its step structure as a comb sized by step duration, alongside a training-load meter relative to the heaviest workout in the library and how long ago the workout was last scheduled. Step structure is fetched only as tiles scroll into view, a few at a time, so browsing the library costs a handful of requests rather than one per workout
- **Gear management** (developer builds only) — read and add COROS activity gear (shoes and bikes) from the account, behind the Dev view toggle while the undocumented mobile endpoints are verified

### Changed

- **One sport identity across the Training Library** — all nine COROS sports get their own colour and icon, so swim, XC ski, the two climbing sports, and HYROX no longer share the generic "other" teal; plan cards and rows take an accent from their dominant sport and show their sport mix as dots. Sports covered by Settings → Activity colors still follow the customized colours
- **Consistent dropdowns throughout the app** — native `<select>` controls in the workout builder, plan editor, and strength step editor are replaced with the app's own dropdown, which renders in a portal so long menus are no longer clipped by the dialog around them, flips above the trigger when there is no room below, and supports type-ahead
- **Media library layout** — transfer actions moved next to the filters, bulk actions float over the track list as a dismissable bar rather than pushing the rows down, and the redundant "selected only" filter on the watch panel is gone
- **Strength attribution is honest about Full Body sets** — COROS records unstructured strength segments only as "Full Body", which names no specific muscle. Those sets are no longer spread across chest, lats, quads, and glutes as if they were measured; they are counted separately and explained on the page, and the muscle map stays neutral when nothing in the window can be attributed
- The ChatGPT account email is no longer displayed in the Coach header or settings panel

### Fixed

- The media library's sync indicator now reports "Syncing…" while a transfer is in flight instead of continuing to show the pending count

## [0.1.25] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- **Training Library** — a dedicated tab for reusable training: search, filter, sort, preview, create, edit, duplicate, tag, collect, export, schedule, and delete COROS Workout Library workouts; build grouped multi-week plans by dragging workouts across days and a holding area, with rest days, phases, recovery weeks, start-date shifting, and undo/redo; keep local templates and collections; and compare two or three plans by duration, distance, training load, strength sets, sport/intensity mix, weekly progression, peak week, taper, shared workouts, and scheduling conflicts. Native COROS plan discovery and detail reads are live and cached; native grouped-plan writes stay visibly gated until the undocumented contract can be verified (see [architecture notes](docs/training-library-architecture.md))
- **AI training plans** — describe a goal, length, weekly availability, sports, and constraints, and Coach drafts a complete plan straight into the library, ready to review, edit workout by workout, and schedule
- **Plan adherence** — scheduled workouts are paired with completed activities by confidence score, with manual correction, skipped/missed/partial states, rescheduling, and planned-versus-completed metrics
- **Hevy strength sync** — connect a Hevy API key from the Strength tab to merge Hevy workouts into your strength history; sessions logged in both apps are de-duplicated, warmup sets are optional, and disconnecting erases the cached Hevy data from this device
- **Exercise Explorer** — open any lift for its full history: every set, per-session PRs, best sets by rep range, estimated one-rep-max progression, and volume over time ([#91](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/91))
- **Coach follow-up questions** — instead of guessing, Coach can ask one clarifying question with two to five tappable answers; a typed reply still works, and the question card survives a restart

### Changed

- **Multi-sport Coach plans** — Coach now uses the athlete's recent activity mix and complete schedule to create adaptive plans across all nine supported COROS workout sports instead of defaulting to running ([#90](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/90))
- **Destination-aware plan confirmation** — before anything is uploaded, Coach's confirmation card shows the destination (Workout Library, Calendar, local template, COROS Plan Library, or plan plus calendar) along with the weeks, workouts, sports, start date, conflicts, and every remote write it will make; Coach's own tools can draft a plan but can never upload one
- **Strength view redesign** — reworked layout and charts, a refined muscle mannequin on roughly 30% smaller anatomy assets, and a weekly chart that plots sets alongside weight lifted ([#91](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/91))
- **Workout builder and activity logging redesign** — restructured movement, prescription, load, and rest editing, exercise demonstration clips showing which muscles each movement trains, and a clearer manual activity form
- Strength volume reads in full words ("1.2 tonnes" rather than "1.2t")
- Activity queries above the COROS 100-per-page limit are now split across multiple requests and stitched back together
- A Donate button in the header, for anyone who wants to support the project

### Fixed

- Coach plan uploads now preserve each workout's sport and sport options instead of treating non-running workouts as Run
- Strength and HYROX plan drafts now resolve harmless exercise-name variants automatically and feed genuine COROS catalog ambiguities back to Coach for same-response correction before preview or upload
- The workout editor opened from a training plan is no longer cropped by the dialog around it

## [0.1.24] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- **Strength tab** — a dedicated view for resistance training, built around a rotatable 3D muscle mannequin that shades each muscle by how hard you have worked it, with per-muscle set/volume/time breakdowns, weekly volume trends, push/pull/legs/core balance, estimated one-rep-max progression, and recent session history ([#84](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/84))
- **Imperial units** — a Metric/Imperial switch in Settings that converts distance, elevation, pace, and weight throughout the app ([#88](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/88))
- **Full-sport workout intensity** — the workout builder now covers all nine COROS sports (Run, Trail Run, Bike, Pool Swim, Strength, Indoor Climb, Bouldering, XC Ski, and HYROX), each with its own step kinds, targets, and intensity presets ([#86](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/86), [#87](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/87))
- Scheduled workout detail view on the calendar, showing a workout's full step structure before it is sent to the watch
- Searchable exercise picker when building strength workouts
- Dev view can preview the Strength tab against a generated sample history, so the page can be worked on without a populated COROS account

### Changed

- **Watch Face Studio panels redesigned** — reworked Layers and Properties panels ([#82](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/82))
- Workout builder polish — step previews and reordering, a faster quick-workout flow, and COROS exercise media in the exercise list

### Fixed

- Combined playlist retry and watch sync ([#81](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/81))
- Sparse watch face templates could not add fixed metrics ([#83](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/83))
- Watch face image imports no longer lose their native size
- Auto-update no longer leaves the downloaded installer in the updater cache after installing it, which duplicated roughly 100MB per release on Windows ([#33](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/issues/33))

- **Cross-watch face conversion** — convert watch faces between supported COROS models in Watch Face Studio ([#77](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/77))

### Fixed

- Combined playlist downloads now detect completed temporary MP3s reliably, preserve actionable download errors, and resume retries from cached tracks instead of downloading the whole playlist again ([#76](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/76))
- Sleep window display parsing and formatting in Training Hub ([#78](https://github.com/JunAkerBuilds/CorosLink/pull/78))

## [0.1.21] - 2026-07-21
